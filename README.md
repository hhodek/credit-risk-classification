# Credit Risk Classification

## Project Overview:
The Credit Risk Analysis project is a data-driven initiative aimed at predicting and assessing credit risk for loans. The project utilizes machine learning models to distinguish between healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1) based on various financial indicators. The objective is to provide a reliable tool for financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, ultimately reducing the likelihood of loan defaults and associated financial losses.

## Key Objectives:
* Develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately predicting credit risk.
* Provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
* Offer recommendations on which model to use for credit risk assessment, considering the balance between identifying high-risk loans and maintaining precision for healthy loans.

## Contents:
Inside the Credit-Risk folder there is:

* Resources folder: This contains the data used in this challenge.

* credit_risk_classification.ipynb: This contains the code and scoring for the models.

* credit-report.md: This contains the analysis of the models performance. It summarizes the key metrics, provides insights into model effectiveness, and makes recommendations for model selection.

## Results and Recommendations:
Both Model 1 and Model 2 exhibit strong predictive capabilities for healthy loans (Class 0).
Model 2, in particular, excels in identifying high-risk loans (Class 1) with a perfect recall score.
Based on the analysis, Model 2 is recommended for credit risk assessment due to its superior performance in identifying high-risk loans, thus mitigating potential financial risks.
